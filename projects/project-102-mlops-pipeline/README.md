## Getting Started

### TODO: Complete Implementation

This project is currently a stub. Your task is to implement the complete MLOps pipeline following the specifications.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Setup Data Pipeline**
   - Implement data ingestion
   - Add DVC for data versioning
   - Create data validation checks

2. **Build Training Pipeline**
   - Implement training script with MLflow tracking
   - Create Airflow DAG for orchestration
   - Add hyperparameter tuning

3. **Setup Model Registry**
   - Configure MLflow Model Registry
   - Implement model versioning workflow
   - Add model validation gates

4. **Implement Deployment Pipeline**
   - Create automated deployment from registry
   - Deploy to Kubernetes (extending Project 01)
   - Add rollback capabilities

5. **Add Monitoring**
   - Track model performance metrics
   - Implement drift detection
   - Setup alerts

6. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing
   - Automated deployment triggers

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Data Pipeline (Airflow DAG)

```python
# TODO: Implement data_pipeline.py
# - Data ingestion task
# - Data validation task
# - Data preprocessing task
# - DVC commit task
```

### 2. Training Pipeline (Airflow DAG)

```python
# TODO: Implement training_pipeline.py
# - Load versioned data
# - Train model with MLflow tracking
# - Register best model
# - Trigger deployment if model improves
```

### 3. Model Registry Workflow

```python
# TODO: Implement model registry logic
# - Staging → Production promotion
# - Model versioning
# - A/B testing support
```

### 4. Deployment Automation

```python
# TODO: Implement deployment automation
# - Automatic deployment on model promotion
# - Rolling update to Kubernetes
# - Rollback on failure
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete pipeline executes successfully end-to-end
- [ ] 5+ experiments tracked in MLflow with metrics
- [ ] Data versioned with DVC and retrievable
- [ ] Model deployed automatically when promoted to Production
- [ ] Pipeline execution time <30 minutes for sample dataset
- [ ] All tests passing with 75%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation allowing reproduction of pipeline
