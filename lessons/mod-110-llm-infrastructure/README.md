# Module 10: LLM Infrastructure

## Module Overview

Welcome to the final module of the AI Infrastructure Engineer curriculum! This module covers Large Language Model (LLM) infrastructure - one of the most rapidly evolving and critical areas in modern AI systems. As organizations increasingly adopt LLMs for chatbots, code generation, document analysis, and countless other applications, the ability to deploy, scale, and optimize LLM infrastructure has become an essential skill for AI infrastructure engineers.

LLM infrastructure presents unique challenges that distinguish it from traditional machine learning infrastructure:

- **Massive Model Sizes**: Models ranging from 7B to 70B+ parameters requiring specialized hardware and serving strategies
- **High Compute Requirements**: GPU clusters, memory optimization, and efficient resource allocation
- **Complex Deployment Patterns**: Inference serving, fine-tuning pipelines, RAG systems, and multi-model platforms
- **Cost Considerations**: Balancing performance with infrastructure costs that can quickly escalate
- **Rapid Innovation**: New optimization techniques, quantization methods, and serving frameworks emerging constantly

This module will equip you with the knowledge and hands-on skills to build production-grade LLM infrastructure, from deploying your first model with vLLM to designing complete multi-model platforms with RAG capabilities.

## Why LLM Infrastructure Matters

The explosion of LLM applications has created unprecedented demand for engineers who can:

1. **Deploy LLMs Efficiently**: Serve models at scale with optimal latency and throughput
2. **Build RAG Systems**: Implement retrieval-augmented generation for domain-specific applications
3. **Optimize Costs**: Reduce infrastructure expenses through quantization, batching, and resource management
4. **Ensure Reliability**: Create highly available LLM services with proper monitoring and failover
5. **Enable Fine-Tuning**: Build infrastructure for customizing models with organizational data
6. **Design Platforms**: Architect complete LLM platforms serving multiple models and use cases

Companies are investing billions in LLM infrastructure, and skilled engineers are commanding premium salaries. Understanding LLM infrastructure opens doors to some of the most exciting projects in tech today.
