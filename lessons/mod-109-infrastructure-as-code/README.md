# Module 09: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Module Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a fundamental practice in modern DevOps and AI infrastructure management. This module teaches you how to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure using code, enabling version control, automation, reproducibility, and collaboration for AI/ML workloads.

## Why This Matters for AI Infrastructure

Managing AI infrastructure manually is error-prone, slow, and doesn't scale. IaC enables you to:

- **Reproducibility**: Deploy identical environments for dev, staging, and production
- **Version Control**: Track infrastructure changes in Git alongside application code
- **Automation**: Integrate infrastructure provisioning into CI/CD pipelines
- **Collaboration**: Enable teams to review and approve infrastructure changes
- **Disaster Recovery**: Rebuild entire infrastructure from code in minutes
- **Cost Management**: Easily spin up/down expensive GPU clusters
- **Multi-Cloud**: Deploy AI workloads across AWS, GCP, Azure with common patterns

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand IaC principles** and benefits for AI infrastructure
2. **Use Terraform** to provision cloud resources for ML workloads
3. **Manage infrastructure state** safely and collaborate with teams
4. **Apply Pulumi** for Python-based infrastructure management
5. **Implement GitOps workflows** for infrastructure changes
6. **Design modular, reusable infrastructure** components
7. **Secure sensitive data** in IaC (credentials, API keys)
8. **Implement CI/CD pipelines** for infrastructure deployment
9. **Apply best practices** for IaC at scale
