# Module 04: Kubernetes Fundamentals

**Duration:** 60 hours
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Prerequisites:** Modules 01, 02, and 03 complete

## Module Overview

Kubernetes (K8s) is the industry-standard platform for container orchestration. This module provides comprehensive coverage of Kubernetes fundamentals with a focus on deploying and managing ML workloads.

You'll learn to deploy ML models on Kubernetes, manage compute resources (including GPUs), implement auto-scaling, and troubleshoot common issues. By the end, you'll be proficient in operating production Kubernetes clusters for ML applications.

## Why Kubernetes for ML?

### The Challenge: Container Orchestration at Scale

**Without Kubernetes:**
- Manually start/stop containers across 100 machines
- No automatic recovery if a container crashes
- Manual load balancing across instances
- Complex networking between services
- Manual scaling up/down
- No built-in service discovery

**With Kubernetes:**
- Declare desired state, K8s maintains it automatically
- Self-healing: restarts failed containers
- Built-in load balancing and service discovery
- Automatic scaling based on metrics
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Standardized deployment across environments

### Real-World Impact

**Example: Netflix**
- 1,000+ microservices on Kubernetes
- Automatic scaling from 100 to 10,000 pods during peak hours
- Self-healing recovers from node failures in seconds

**Example: Spotify**
- 200+ Kubernetes clusters globally
- GPU scheduling for ML model training
- ~80% cost reduction through efficient resource utilization

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Understand K8s Architecture** - Explain control plane, nodes, pods, and core concepts
2. **Deploy Applications** - Deploy ML models as Kubernetes Deployments
3. **Manage Resources** - Use ConfigMaps, Secrets, Persistent Volumes
4. **Configure Networking** - Set up Services, Ingress, load balancing
5. **Schedule GPU Workloads** - Deploy GPU-accelerated ML inference and training
6. **Use Helm Charts** - Package and deploy applications with Helm
7. **Implement Auto-Scaling** - Configure HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
8. **Monitor Clusters** - Set up basic monitoring with kubectl and metrics
9. **Troubleshoot Issues** - Debug pods, services, networking problems
10. **Apply Best Practices** - Security, resource limits, health checks
