# Lesson 01: Introduction to ML Infrastructure

**Duration:** 3 hours
**Objectives:** Understand the field of ML infrastructure, career paths, and key concepts

## Welcome!

Welcome to your journey into AI Infrastructure Engineering! This lesson introduces you to a rapidly growing field that sits at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and infrastructure operations.

## What is ML Infrastructure?

**ML Infrastructure** is the set of systems, tools, and practices that enable machine learning models to be built, deployed, and maintained in production environments.

Think of it this way:
- **Data Scientists** design and train models
- **ML Infrastructure Engineers** build the systems that make those models useful in the real world

### Key Responsibilities

As an ML Infrastructure Engineer, you'll:

1. **Deploy ML models** to production environments
2. **Build data pipelines** that feed models with training and inference data
3. **Monitor systems** for performance, reliability, and model quality
4. **Optimize infrastructure** for cost, speed, and scalability
5. **Automate workflows** for training, testing, and deployment
6. **Manage compute resources** including GPUs and distributed systems
7. **Collaborate with data scientists** to translate requirements into infrastructure

### The Challenge

ML infrastructure is uniquely challenging because:

- **Models aren't static** - They need retraining, versioning, A/B testing
- **Data is critical** - Data quality, versioning, and lineage affect model performance
- **Compute is expensive** - GPUs and distributed training cost significantly
- **Scale matters** - Inference can require millions of requests per second
- **Failures are subtle** - Model degradation can happen silently over time

## ML Infrastructure vs Traditional Infrastructure

| Traditional Infrastructure | ML Infrastructure |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Deploy static applications | Deploy models that change over time |
| Focus on availability and performance | Add model quality and data quality |
| Code versioning (Git) | Code + data + model versioning |
| Scaling based on traffic | Scaling based on traffic + training workloads |
| Standard monitoring (CPU, memory, requests) | Add model metrics (accuracy, drift, bias) |
| Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD | + MLflow, Airflow, specialized GPU management |

**ML infrastructure builds on traditional DevOps/SRE skills** but adds machine learning-specific concerns.

## What is MLOps?

**MLOps** (Machine Learning Operations) is the set of practices that combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to:

- Deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably and efficiently
- Automate the ML lifecycle from data collection to model deployment
- Monitor and improve models continuously
