---

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow **PEP 8** with some modifications:

```python
# Use type hints
def train_model(data: np.ndarray, epochs: int = 10) -> torch.nn.Module:
    """
    Train a machine learning model.

    Args:
        data: Training data as numpy array
        epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 10)

    Returns:
        Trained PyTorch model
    """
    pass

# Use descriptive variable names
model_checkpoint_path = "/data/checkpoints"  # Good
mcp = "/data/checkpoints"  # Bad

# Add docstrings to all public functions
# Use Google-style docstrings
```

**Tools:**
- **black**: Code formatter (line length: 100)
- **flake8**: Linter
- **mypy**: Type checker
- **isort**: Import sorter

### Markdown Style

```markdown
# Use ATX-style headers

## Add blank lines around headers

Use **bold** for emphasis, *italic* for terms.

\`\`\`python
# Always specify language in code blocks
def example():
    pass
\`\`\`

- Use hyphens for unordered lists
1. Use numbers for ordered lists
```

### Documentation Style

**File naming:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `getting-started.md`
- Be descriptive: `aws-ml-infrastructure.md` not `aws.md`

**Structure:**
- Start with title and brief description
- Add table of contents for docs > 500 words
- Use consistent header levels
- End with "Next Steps" or "Summary"

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow **Conventional Commits** specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(module-01): Add Docker basics lesson"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(project-01): Correct FastAPI endpoint validation"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(readme): Update installation instructions"

# With body
git commit -m "feat(module-02): Add AWS ML infrastructure lesson

- Add EC2 GPU instance configuration
- Include S3 storage best practices
- Add code examples for SageMaker

Closes #123"
```

### Best Practices

- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Capitalize subject line
- No period at end of subject
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Reference issues in footer
