## Technical Questions

### What programming languages do I need to know?

Primarily **Python**. You should be comfortable with:
- Functions and classes
- File I/O and error handling
- Package management (pip, venv)
- Basic async/await concepts

### Which cloud provider should I use?

Ideally, all three (AWS, GCP, Azure) as Module 02 covers each. However, you can start with any one:
- **AWS**: Most popular in industry, extensive ML services
- **GCP**: Strong ML/AI focus, good for experimentation
- **Azure**: Growing fast, good for enterprise

All have free tier or credits for new users.

### Do I need a GPU?

**For local development:** No, most exercises work on CPU.

**For training projects:** You'll need GPU access, but you can use:
- Cloud GPU instances (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Google Colab (free tier available)
- Kaggle notebooks (free GPU access)

### What if I get stuck on an exercise?

1. Re-read the lesson material
2. Check the FAQ (you're here!)
3. Search existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ai-infra-curriculum/ai-infra-engineer-learning/issues)
4. Ask in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ai-infra-curriculum/ai-infra-engineer-learning/discussions)
5. Open a new issue with the `question` label

### Can I skip modules?

While the curriculum is designed to be progressive, you can skip modules if you already have the knowledge. However:
- Complete the quiz to verify your understanding
- Make sure you have the prerequisite skills for later modules

## Project Questions

### How do I know if my project is correct?

Since these are learning projects with code stubs:
1. All tests should pass (when you implement the TODOs)
2. The application should run without errors
3. Compare your implementation against best practices in the lessons
4. Share your code in Discussions for community feedback

### Can I use different technologies than suggested?

Yes! The stubs provide one approach, but you're encouraged to:
- Try alternative frameworks or libraries
- Implement additional features
- Optimize for different requirements

Share your alternative implementations in Discussions!

### Should I complete all projects?

**Yes**, if you want the full learning experience. Each project reinforces different concepts:
- Project 01: Foundations (serving, Docker, K8s)
- Project 02: Distributed training
- Project 03: MLOps pipelines
- Project 04: Auto-scaling systems
- Project 05: Complete ML platform

### Can I add projects to my portfolio?

Absolutely! All project code you write is yours. These projects make excellent portfolio pieces for job applications.

## Cloud & Cost Questions

### How much will cloud resources cost?

**Estimated total cost:** <$100 if you exceed free tier limits.

**Cost breakdown:**
- Module 01-02 (AWS/GCP/Azure basics): Free tier
- Module 03-04 (Kubernetes): ~$20
- Module 05-06 (Distributed training): ~$30-50
- Module 07-10 (Production systems): ~$20-30

**Cost-saving tips:**
- Use free tier whenever possible
- Shut down resources when not in use
- Use spot/preemptible instances (60-90% cheaper)
- Set billing alerts

### How do I avoid unexpected cloud bills?

1. **Set up billing alerts** immediately (recommended: $10, $25, $50)
2. **Shut down resources** after each session
3. **Use cloud budget tools**:
   - AWS Budgets
   - GCP Budget Alerts
   - Azure Cost Management
4. **Monitor usage daily**
5. **Use auto-shutdown scripts** (provided in lessons)

### Can I complete the course without cloud access?

Module 01 can be completed locally. However, Modules 02+ require cloud access for:
- Cloud storage and networking
- Managed ML services
- Kubernetes clusters
- Distributed training

You can use free tier/credits to minimize costs.
