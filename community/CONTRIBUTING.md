## 📐 Style Guidelines

### Documentation

- **Use clear, concise language**
- **Include examples** for complex concepts
- **Add code comments** explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- **Follow Markdown best practices**
- **Use proper heading hierarchy**

### Code

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, commented, follows TODO pattern
def train_model(config: ModelConfig) -> TrainedModel:
    """
    Train ML model with given configuration.

    Args:
        config: Model configuration object

    Returns:
        Trained model ready for evaluation

    TODO:
    1. Load training data
    2. Initialize model architecture
    3. Set up optimizer and loss function
    4. Train for specified epochs
    5. Save checkpoints
    6. Return trained model
    """
    # TODO: Implement training logic
    pass


# ❌ Avoid: No docs, no guidance
def train(c):
    pass
```

### File Organization

```
# For new exercises:
lessons/XX-module-name/
├── exercises/
│   ├── exercise-01-name.md      # Problem statement
│   ├── exercise-01-starter.py   # Starter code with TODOs
│   └── solutions/
│       └── exercise-01-solution.py  # Full solution

# For new documentation:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Keep related content together
- Update parent README to link to new content
```

## 🧪 Testing Contributions

Before submitting:

1. **Test code changes**
   ```bash
   # If you added/modified code:
   pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Verify links**
   - Check all links work
   - Verify code examples run
   - Test any shell commands

3. **Check formatting**
   ```bash
   # Python code
   black src/
   flake8 src/
   ```
